pyWordyClock is a simple command line script that outputs an artsy, approximate, multiline clock. 

Usage:
run "pyWordyClockFace" to see the full clock face.
run "pyWordyClock" to see the time projected on the clock face. 

Putting it on your desktop. 
pyWordyClock works great with simple "text on your desktop" type applications such as:
 - GeekTool3 on Mac OS X
 - Conky on Linux
 - Rainmeter on Windows
 
While the integration process is different per application, the implementation is the same:

1. Place the clock face on the Desktop. 
  - Create a widget that will display the output of "pyWordyClockFace" to get clock face on the desktop. 
  - The font should be monospaced, and the font should not be as bright as the color of the actual clock. 
  
2. Place the actual clock on the Desktop as well
  - Create another widget that will display the output of "pyWordyClock" on the desktop.
  - The font should be exactly the same as the clock face. It should have a brighter color to stand out. 
  
3. Position the actual clock directly over the clock face
  - I find it easier to get the absolute position of the clock face, and then use those same numbers with clock.
  
4. Save and you're done!
